always predicting a function X --> Y

X = input
Y = output

X = data
Y = label


get parameters that estimate Y_hat = f(X)
in other words Y_prediction = machine_learning_model_params(X_input)


### training phase
training_input, training_output
use training_input and training_output --> model params


### testing phase, use test_input and test_output
use model params to make predictions on test_data (== test_input)


call these your test_predictions

i want to see if how many test_predictions are == test_output


##### dot product
if you have 2 vectors, x = [x1, x2, x3], w = [w1, w2, w3]
the dot product dot(x,w) = x1*w1 + x2*w2 + x3*w3


####### format of X
- input is a matrix - of size (N, D)
- N number of samples
- D is number of dimensions == number of words == vocabulary size
- one row of X is one sample
X = [
	x1
	x2
	x3
	....
	xN
]

Y = [1, 20, 3, 4, 5, 1, ...]

ll_1 = w1*x + b1

ll_2 = w2*x + b2
